# CSCD496-001 S19 Final Project

### Description
There are many interesting real-world machine learning problems that can be investigated by participating in data competitions that are freely available to join on the internet.  Instead of a final exam, each student will be part of a team using the rules and data of one of these contests to demonstrate knowledge of the tools of machine learning.

projects can be chosen from [KDD cup projects](http://www.kdd.org/kdd-cup) or from [kaggle competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions).

### Before you begin:
You will need a few things before beginning this project:

* Project team member list.  One member of the project team must send a list of all team members to me (week 2).
* A topic for the project.  The project topic will include a data set and a task to perform.  Ideally, you will meet as a team and select some project task and data that seems interesting.  Then you should come to me and I will approve your topic and the use of the data.  

Once these initial steps are complete, you can start creating the deliverables outlined below.

### Deliverables:

* A project proposal containing (Due: week 6)
  * Description of the project
  * Description of the data source
  * Related work
  * Initial ideas/methodologies for solution
  * Proposed milestones 
  * References 
  
* Project progress containing (Due: Week 8)
  * Introduction of the project
  * Literature review
  * Proposed solution
  * Current progress
  * Future work
  * References
  
* Presentation of the final project containing (Due: Week 11).
  * Introduction of the project
  * Related work
  * Methodology and (or) design
  * Results
  * Conclusions and future work
  * References
* A comprehensive project report that includes (Due: June 14, last day of Finals week):
  * Introduction: the description of the problem you are addressing, overview of your approach, and so on;
  * Related Work and Background: a literature review of previous work in this area;
  * Methodology and Design: the description of your approach, solution strategy, styles/design, and so on;
  * Results: the experiments, datasets, discussion of results, comparisons with other benchmarks, and so on;
  * Conclusions and Future Work: components that have been implemented and components that can be improved;
  * References;
  * Appendix: (a) the instructions on how to run your programs, and (b) results/output/graphs that are not included in Results.

#### Deliverables and Grading:
The project will be graded in four parts: 

1. Project Proposal (20%)
2. Progress Presentation (30%)
3. Final Presentation (30%)
4. Final Report (20%)

#### Peer Evaluations:
You also need to send me the peer-evaluation on the second and the final  deliverables through email. This means you need to send me two (2) peer-evaluations throughout this quarter. 

#### Instruction for peer-evaluation:
* You are allotted (N x 100) points where N equals the total number of members in your team. 
*  You are to distribute these points among your teammates (including yourself) in any way you deem appropriate. 
*  Legal point assignments are in whole points only (so 13 is legal; 12.45 is not). 
*  You must use up all (N x 100) points in your distribution. 

Think of the points as "effort points": Ideally, if everyone has been performing as expected, putting in their fair share of effort, you would give each of your teammates 100 points. This would mean that all team members have been doing 100% of what you expected of them. However, if you judge that a particular member (including yourself) has done more than his/her fair share of the work, then you may opt to give that person more than 100 points. Of course, this means that 1 or more of the other members will receive less than 100 points in order to keep the total points distributed at (N x 100).
